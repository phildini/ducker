# ducker
Quack at your docs

```
<aldeka_a_> idea for trolling: give a lightning talk at pycon about a new program called 'ducker', a helpful eliza-type bot that will help you rubber-duck through problems with major libraries, starting with docker but expanding outward from there
<aldeka_a_> like, a program that consumes sphinx documentation and outputs incisive 20-questions style questions. or at least feigns nodding in sympathy well.
<aldeka_a_> actually the more I think about it the more I think this is something that could be a real and useful thing. troll fail.
